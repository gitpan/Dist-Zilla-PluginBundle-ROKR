=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyMakefilePLFromBuild - Copy Makefile.PL after building (for SCM inclusion, etc.)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0018

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your L<Dist::Zilla> C<dist.ini>:

    [CopyMakefilePLFromBuild]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CopyMakefilePLFromBuild will automatically copy the Makefile.PL from
the build directory into the distribution directory. This is so you
can commit the Makefile.PL to version control. When building directly
from GitHub (via cpanm, for example) you would need a Makefile.PL

Dist::Zilla will not like it if you already have a Makefile.PL, so
you'll want to prune that file, an example of which is:

    [GatherDir]     ; gathers files - including Makefile.PL
    [PruneFiles]    ; removes some files
    filenames = Makefile.PL
    [MakeMaker]     ; generates your Makefile.PL for the build dir
    [CopyMakefilePLFromBuild] ; copies the generated Makefile.PL back

=head1 AfterBuild/AfterRelease

With the release of 0.0016, this plugin changed to performing the copy during the AfterRelease stage instead of the AfterBuild stage.
To enable the old behavior, set the environment variable DZIL_CopyFromBuildAfterBuild to 1:

    $ DZIL_CopyFromBuildAfterBuild=1 dzil build
